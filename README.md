### phpEmail Guide

## What local server should I use?
```sh
You can try using local servers such as WAMP and make sure to put the phpEmail folder inside the directory wamp64 --> www folder.
For XAMPP the phpEmail folder should be inside the htdocs folder
```

## I don't have the option "App Password" on my google account, was it removed?

```sh
Make sure to enable 2 step verification first.
```

## Error: Form submission failed and no error message returned from: email.php?

```sh
Make sure to clone the source code using git, turn on local sever, and run localhost/phpEmail in the search bar.
```

## Uncaught PHPMailer\PHPMailer\Exception: SMTP Error: Could not authenticate?

```sh
You need to create a google app password and make sure that you have provided the correct information such as the generated app password/your email address. You can also refer to the source code provided by me.
